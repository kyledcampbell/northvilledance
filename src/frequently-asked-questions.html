                  <p>No, you don't need a partner to learn to dance. At Arthur Murray, you can learn to dance on your own or with someone special. Whether you are a single, couple, or have a partner that isn’t interested in learning to dance, you are welcome to join us and learn.  We have a great community of dancers and a welcoming environment that includes all types and ages of people.</p>

                  <p>While our instructors dress in business attire, our students wear a variety of things: anything from jeans and a t-shirt, to work attire, to getting all dressed up for a night out of dancing. For shoes, just make sure you wear something that won’t slip off your feet while dancing. Ballroom dancing shoes are not required.</p>

                  <p>It totally depends on how quickly you learn, how good you’d like to become, and how many dances you’d like to learn. Just to learn a few basics only takes a handful of lessons. To be comfortable dancing to any music with any partner, that takes about 6 months to a year. After your first lesson, your instructor will be able to recommend the quickest way to get to your dancing goals.</p>

It's also a chance for your instructors to see how you learn and make recommendations to give you the best service possible. Even if you've never danced before, you'll be dancing on your very first lesson. </p>

                  <p>While there are a few dances we recommend learning after you’re more acquainted with the basics, MOST styles of dance are actually very simple to learn.

                  <p>Yes! Ballroom dancing is a great skill to learn at a young age. It helps to learn coordination, manners, and socialization. We do recommend that they start ballroom dancing once they reach age 5.</p>

                  <p>Yes! Ballroom dancing is great exercise. Whether you are looking to lose weight, stay fit, or rehabilitate, dancing is a great low-impact exercise. It’s also one of the only physical exercises that’s proven to help stave off degenerative diseases like alzheimer's and dementia. Whatever your health goals, dancing can help.</p>
