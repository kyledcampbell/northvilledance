            <p>
              The Two-Step is the most popular Country Western partner dance, a
              staple in any country bar. Dancers follow a counter-clockwise line
              of dance, effortlessly spinning and weaving between other couples.
              Characterized by a straightforward rhythm and smooth, linear
              movement, this dance showcases exciting partner styling and rapid
              spins, reminiscent of a cowboy wielding his rope. Steps like the
              Lasso and the Lariat pay homage to the Western roots of this
              dance.
            </p>
            <h3 id="country-swing">Country Western Swing Lessons</h3>
            <p>
              The Country Swing is a dynamic spot dance with partners in
              constant, electrifying motion. Couples tear up the floor with
              looping arms, thrilling dips and barrel-roll spins! Along with the
              Two-Step, Swing is one of the easiest and most essential dances
              with which to begin your country dance journey.
