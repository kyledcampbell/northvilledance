          <p>
            With its exact origins shrouded to this day in mystery, the
            Argentine Tango blazed out of 19th century Buenos Aires, to become a
            global phenomenon. To the unique music of the bandoneon, a type of
            accordion, dancers move to the "Ritmo del Corazon", the Rhythm of
            the Heart. Partners glide across the floor, blending slow sensual
            movements with hypnotizing shapes and leg styling. Although a
            wonderful dance for beginners, true Tango mastery becomes for many a
            lifelong pursuit.

            <h3 id="vals">Tango Vals Lessons</h3>
            <p>
              Taking inspiration from the waltzes of Vienna, Tango musicians
              began around 1910 to compose songs with a swaying 3/4 rhythm. The
              Tango Vals is accompanied by a strong underlying pulse and
              exciting musical rhythms. Dancers incorporate sweeping elegant
              movements, inspired by the Viennese Waltz. With a basic knowledge
              of Argentine Tango, newcomer Tango Vals dancers can have fun with
              classic Tango patterns, such as Salida and Ochos.
            </p>
            <h3 id="milonga">Milonga Lessons</h3>
            <p>
              Milonga is a term used for both a social tango gathering, as well
              as the faster version of the Tango itself. With lightning-fast
              footwork and playful movements, advanced Milonga dancers put the
              thrilling musical rhythm at center stage. Beginners can enjoy the
              Milonga by simply walking to the beat of the music!
