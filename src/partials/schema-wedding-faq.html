            Having a planned dance is the easiest way to make your wedding
            special. How many weddings have you been to where everyone
            awkwardly stares at the lovely couple swaying back and forth
            for 4 minutes? Taking wedding dance lessons gives you the
            opportunity to create a special moment at your reception that
            you’ll remember forever.

          <p>
            Not only will you learn a wedding dance, but you’ll actually
            learn how to dance together. It truly is one of the best gifts
            you can give each other on your special day. Instead of being
            at the bar, you’ll be on the floor enjoying the countless
            weddings you’ll attend in the future.

          "text": "<p>
            Generally, there are three ways couples choose to structure
            their wedding dance:
          </p>
          <h3>Choreography</h3>
          <p>
            A set of planned steps. Choreography can be as simple or
            flashy as you’d like. It’s a great way to take the stress off
            of learning a dance when you know what comes next. Having
            choreography can give you the repetition and muscle memory
            much faster.
          </p>
          <h3>Lead and Follow:</h3>
          <p>
            An impromptu method where the leader gives signals of what
            they want to do next and the follower responds. Lead and
            follow is a great way to learn to social dance. You’ll learn
            the different signals and won’t have to worry if you miss a
            step in your routine. Keep in mind, it will require a little
            more patience with your partner as you get comfortable with
            communicating these signals.
          </p>
          <h3>Combination of Both:</h3>
          <p>
            A combination of both choreography and lead and follow means
            that certain parts of the dance are specific steps and other
            sections are impromptu lead and follow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your instructor will be able to recommend what is best for you
            based on how you learn, your timeline, as well as the look and
            feel you’d like for your dance.

            After answering a few questions about your venue, dress, and
            the look and feel you’d like to have, your instructor will
            guide you through a few basics of dancing. You’ll already
            start learning parts of your wedding dance on your very first
            lesson and leave with a plan of action between now and the
            wedding.

            Absolutely not. If you haven’t decided a song, your instructor
            will show you a few basic steps that go to any style of music.
            The biggest hurdle in learning to dance for a wedding is
            getting the basics down. Once you do decide on a song, they’ll
            help you personalize it to the music.

          "text": " <p>
            We recommend a wedding dance should be around 1 min 30
            seconds- 2 minutes (maximum). While that might seem short,
            it’s actually quite a bit of time, and quite a bit of steps
            and/or choreography to learn and remember. Even those fancy
            routines on Dancing With the Stars typically last anywhere
            from 1:15-1:40.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re doing more than one song for your first dance, the
            time can be longer and your instructor will recommend
            accordingly.

            Yes! That is actually a service included with your wedding

            it would only make sense that we cut the song for you as well.

            The sooner the better. Planning a wedding can be very
            stressful and quite costly. Coming in early allows you to
            enjoy learning to dance together without a tight deadline. It
            gives you more time, in case you need it, and gives you plenty
            of time to practice. Learning to dance together should be a
            fun part of getting married.

            Your instructor will make individual recommendations based on
            the complexity of your dance, how quickly you learn, and your
            timeline. But, the most important thing to remember is that
            consistency is key. Learning to dance is a skill, and with any
            skill, it takes small amounts of consistent repetition.
          </p>
          <p>
            While some couples do wedding bootcamps, most couples come in
            once or twice a week for private wedding dance lessons leading
            up to their wedding.

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "<p>
            That completely depends on you! The more complex a dance, the
            more time it takes to learn. If you want something simple, it
            might only take a handful of lessons. If you want something a
            little flashy, that takes a little longer. Lastly, if you want
            a full-on YouTube sensation, that can take several months up
            to a year.
          </p>
          <p>
            It all depends on how fast you learn, how consistent you are
            with your private lessons, and the complexity of your dance.
            Our instructors are great at recommending a plan on your very
            first lesson.

            For the first couple of lessons, we recommend wearing the
            shoes you are most comfortable in. That way, you can focus
            solely on getting the steps down and not worried about getting
            them dirty. As it gets closer to the wedding, you'll
            definitely want to bring your wedding shoes to practice in.
            You'll be 100% comfortable on the big day and have no unwanted
            surprises.

            Choosing a song for your first dance is entirely personal.
            There is no right or wrong way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Questions to ask yourself when choosing a song: Was there a
            song that you first danced to as a couple? Is there a special
            memory that you had together featuring a special song or a
            song that reminds you of that time? Is there a song that’s
            lyrics are everything you want to say to your future spouse?
          </p>
          <p>
            While there are trending wedding songs from year to year, the
            biggest question to ask yourself is “Do I like it?” Your first
            dance together is something you’ll always remember. Make it to
            something you love!
