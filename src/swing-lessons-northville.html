          <p>
            As the song goes: "It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that
            swing!" When New York big bands began to swing in the 1920s, dancers
            took to their feet, creating iconic styles such as the Charleston,
            the Balboa and the Lindy Hop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to its uplifting music, engaging social interaction and
            physical benefits, partygoers on both sides of the Atlantic became
            hooked on Swing dancing. At Arthur Murray Dance Studios, we focus on
            three main styles of Swing: East Coast Swing, Lindy Hop, and West
            Coast Swing.

            <p>
              Named in honor of aviator Charles "Lucky Lindy" Lindbergh, this
              dance is highly revered by enthusiasts, especially those who have
              a deep appreciation of the history and culture of Swing dancing.
              Accompanied by fast-tempo music, the Lindy Hop dazzles with
              syncopated shuffles and energetic kicks, showcasing a thrilling
              blend of agility and flair, stylishly inspired by the Charleston.
            </p>
            <h3 id="west-coast">West Coast Swing Lessons</h3>
            <p>
              When the music slows down, "Westies" step up, executing smooth,
              precise movements with a laid-back swagger that defines the
              quintessential cool of West Coast Swing. Originating from
              California in the 1940s and dubbed "Sophisticated Swing", this
              dance stands in elegant contrast to the riotous Lindy Hop.
