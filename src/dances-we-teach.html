              <p class="classes">Although not developed until the 1980s, this social dance gained popularity among nightclubs across the country. Its relaxed hold and slow to medium tempo make it perfect for social occasions. Famous songs include Chris de Burgh’s “Lady In Red” and Rupert Holmes’ “Escape (The Piña Colada Song)”.

              <p class="classes">Featured in movies like 'Saturday Night Fever' and 'Thank God It’s Friday', in the 1970s, disco became all the rage. Shortly after, a new form developed called “Touch Disco”, the partnered Hustle we know today. This high-energy dance features lots of spins, turns, and wraps and is not only danced to hits from the Bee Gees but today’s artists like Bruno Mars and Maroon 5.</p>
