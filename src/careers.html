            never stop learning, and can be a part of something greater than
            yourself…not to mention, add a bit of Hollywood glamour to your
            everyday life.

              Teach dance for a living: Teach Private lessons and group classes
              while dancing the night away at our weekly practice parties. Meet
              people from all walks of life, travel and compete (if you so
              desire), and join the biggest dance family in the world. All this,
              while getting world-class training from Arthur Murray’s finest.
              This is not an office job; make a career out of dancing!
