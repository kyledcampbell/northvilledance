              The closer you get to the wedding, the more hectic the schedule
              becomes. Starting your wedding dance lessons several months in
              advance allows you plenty of time to learn your dance without the
              stress of a tight deadline. It also gives you more time, in case
              you need it.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your wedding is right around the corner, don't worry, it’s
              never too late!

                  Having a planned dance is the easiest way to make your wedding
                  special. How many weddings have you been to where everyone
                  awkwardly stares at the lovely couple swaying back and forth
                  for 4 minutes? Taking wedding dance lessons gives you the
                  opportunity to create a special moment at your reception that
                  you’ll remember forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not only will you learn a wedding dance, but you’ll actually
                  learn how to dance together. It truly is one of the best gifts
                  you can give each other on your special day. Instead of being
                  at the bar, you’ll be on the floor enjoying the countless
                  weddings you’ll attend in the future.

                  Generally, there are three ways couples choose to structure
                  their wedding dance:
                </p>
                <h3>Choreography</h3>
                <p>
                  A set of planned steps. Choreography can be as simple or
                  flashy as you’d like. It’s a great way to take the stress off
                  of learning a dance when you know what comes next. Having
                  choreography can give you the repetition and muscle memory
                  much faster.
                </p>
                <h3>Lead and Follow:</h3>
                <p>
                  An impromptu method where the leader gives signals of what
                  they want to do next and the follower responds. Lead and
                  follow is a great way to learn to social dance. You’ll learn
                  the different signals and won’t have to worry if you miss a
                  step in your routine. Keep in mind, it will require a little
                  more patience with your partner as you get comfortable with
                  communicating these signals.
                </p>
                <h3>Combination of Both:</h3>
                <p>
                  A combination of both choreography and lead and follow means
                  that certain parts of the dance are specific steps and other
                  sections are impromptu lead and follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your instructor will be able to recommend what is best for you
                  based on how you learn, your timeline, as well as the look and
                  feel you’d like for your dance.

                  After answering a few questions about your venue, dress, and
                  the look and feel you’d like to have, your instructor will
                  guide you through a few basics of dancing. You’ll already
                  start learning parts of your wedding dance on your very first
                  lesson and leave with a plan of action between now and the
                  wedding.

              <dd class="tab-content">
                <p>
                  Absolutely not. If you haven’t decided a song, your instructor
                  will show you a few basic steps that go to any style of music.
                  The biggest hurdle in learning to dance for a wedding is
                  getting the basics down. Once you do decide on a song, they’ll
                  help you personalize it to the music.

                  We recommend a wedding dance should be around 1 min 30
                  seconds- 2 minutes (maximum). While that might seem short,
                  it’s actually quite a bit of time, and quite a bit of steps
                  and/or choreography to learn and remember. Even those fancy
                  routines on Dancing With the Stars typically last anywhere
                  from 1:15-1:40.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you’re doing more than one song for your first dance, the
                  time can be longer and your instructor will recommend
                  accordingly.

                  The sooner the better. Planning a wedding can be very
                  stressful and quite costly. Coming in early allows you to
                  enjoy learning to dance together without a tight deadline. It
                  gives you more time, in case you need it, and gives you plenty
                  of time to practice. Learning to dance together should be a
                  fun part of getting married.

                  Your instructor will make individual recommendations based on
                  the complexity of your dance, how quickly you learn, and your
                  timeline. But, the most important thing to remember is that
                  consistency is key. Learning to dance is a skill, and with any
                  skill, it takes small amounts of consistent repetition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While some couples do wedding bootcamps, most couples come in
                  once or twice a week for private wedding dance lessons leading
                  up to their wedding.

                <p>
                  That completely depends on you! The more complex a dance, the
                  more time it takes to learn. If you want something simple, it
                  might only take a handful of lessons. If you want something a
                  little flashy, that takes a little longer. Lastly, if you want
                  a full-on YouTube sensation, that can take several months up
                  to a year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It all depends on how fast you learn, how consistent you are
                  with your private lessons, and the complexity of your dance.
                  Our instructors are great at recommending a plan on your very
                  first lesson.
                </p>

                  For the first couple of lessons, we recommend wearing the
                  shoes you are most comfortable in. That way, you can focus
                  solely on getting the steps down and not worried about getting
                  them dirty. As it gets closer to the wedding, you'll
                  definitely want to bring your wedding shoes to practice in.
                  You'll be 100% comfortable on the big day and have no unwanted
                  surprises.

                  Choosing a song for your first dance is entirely personal.
                  There is no right or wrong way.

                  Questions to ask yourself when choosing a song: Was there a
                  song that you first danced to as a couple? Is there a special
                  memory that you had together featuring a special song or a
                  song that reminds you of that time? Is there a song that’s
                  lyrics are everything you want to say to your future spouse?
                </p>

                  While there are trending wedding songs from year to year, the
                  biggest question to ask yourself is “Do I like it?” Your first
                  dance together is something you’ll always remember. Make it to
                  something you love!
